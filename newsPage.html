		<h2>COVID: WHO sees growing proof Omicron causes milder symptoms</h2>
		<br>
		<p>WHO Incident Manager Abdi Mahamud says studies point to the Omicron variant infecting upper part of the body, rather than lungs.
<br><br>
		A World Health Organization (WHO) official has said evidence is growing that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is affecting the upper respiratory tract, which results in milder symptoms than previous strains.
<br><br>
“We are seeing more and more studies pointing out that Omicron is infecting the upper part of the body. Unlike the other ones, that could cause severe pneumonia,” WHO Incident Manager Abdi Mahamud told a media briefing in Geneva.</p>
